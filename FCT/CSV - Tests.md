### Group 1: Functional Programming in Coq**

#### Question 1

Consider the following Coq definition of binary trees with natural values as nodes:

	Inductive tree : Type :=
	| Leaf
	| Node (l : tree) (v : nat) (r : tree).

Define the property "a tree has all values satisfying a given predicate PPP" using the following rules:

1. **AllSatisfyLeaf**: `AllSatisfy P Leaf`.
2. **AllSatisfyNode**: If P(v)P(v)P(v) holds and both subtrees satisfy PPP, then the whole tree satisfies PPP: `AllSatisfy P (Node l v r)`.

Complete the following Coq definition for `AllSatisfy` according to these rules:

	Inductive AllSatisfy : (nat → Prop) → tree → Prop := (* Your answer here *)

#### Solution:
	Inductive AllSatisfy : (nat → Prop) → tree → Prop := 
	| AllSatisfyLeaf : ∀ P, AllSatisfy P Leaf 
	| AllSatisfyNode : ∀ (P : nat → Prop) (l r : tree) (v : nat),
		 P v → AllSatisfy P l → AllSatisfy P r → AllSatisfy P (Node l v r).

#### Question 2

Define the property "there exists a node in a tree such that all values in that subtree satisfy a given predicate PPP", using the rules:

1. **ExistsSubtreeVal**: P(v)P(v)P(v) holds for the node itself.
2. **ExistsSubtreeLeft**: There exists a subtree in the left child of a node that satisfies PPP.
3. **ExistsSubtreeRight**: There exists a subtree in the right child of a node that satisfies PPP.

Complete the following Coq definition for `ExistsSubtree`:

	Inductive ExistsSubtree : (nat → Prop) → tree → Prop := (* Your answer here *)

### Solution:
	Inductive ExistsSubtree : (nat → Prop) → tree → Prop := 
	| ExistsSubtreeVal : ∀ (P : nat → Prop) (v : nat) (l r : tree), 
		AllSatisfy P (Node l v r) → ExistsSubtree P (Node l v r) 
	| ExistsSubtreeLeft : ∀ (P : nat → Prop) (l r : tree) (v : nat), 
		ExistsSubtree P l → ExistsSubtree P (Node l v r) 
	| ExistsSubtreeRight : ∀ (P : nat → Prop) (l r : tree) (v : nat), 
		ExistsSubtree P r → ExistsSubtree P (Node l v r).
### Group 2: Loops and Loop Invariants in Dafny

Consider the following Dafny program to find the maximum element in an array:

	method findMax (a : array<int>, n : int) returns (max : int) 
		requires 0 <= n <= a.Length 
		ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> a[i] <= max 
	{ 
		max := a[0]; 
		var i := 1; 
		
		while i < n 
			decreases n - i 
			invariant 1 <= i <= n 
			invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> a[j] <= max 
		{ 
			if a[i] > max { 
				max := a[i]; 
			} 
			i := i + 1; 
		} 
	}

#### Question 3

Complete the Dafny specifications for `findMax` by filling in the strongest possible post-conditions and weakest pre-conditions:

- The pre-condition specifies the valid range for the input array.
- The post-condition ensures the `max` variable is the maximum value found in the array up to index `n`.

### Solution:
	method findMax (a : array<int>, n : int) returns (max : int) 
		requires 0 <= n <= a.Length 
		ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> a[i] <= max 
	{ 
		max := a[0]; 
		var i := 1; 
		
		while i < n 
			decreases n - i 
			invariant 1 <= i <= n 
			invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> a[j] <= max 
		{ 
			if a[i] > max { 
				max := a[i]; 
			} 
			i := i + 1; 
		} 
	}

### Group 3: Abstract Data Types

#### Question 4

Consider an Abstract Data Type (ADT) representing a simple stack. In this stack, you can `push` elements to the top, `pop` elements from the top, and `isEmpty` to check if the stack is empty.

Define the following Dafny methods for the Stack ADT, including appropriate pre-conditions, post-conditions, and loop invariants where necessary:

1. **`method push(x: T)`**:
    
    - Requires that the stack has not reached its maximum capacity.
    - Ensures that the size of the stack increases by one.
2. **`method pop() returns (r: T)`**:
    
    - Requires that the stack is not empty.
    - Ensures that the size of the stack decreases by one.
3. **`method clear()`**:
    
    - Removes all elements from the stack.
    - Ensures the stack is empty afterward.

:

	class Stack<T> 
	{ 
		var data : array<T> 
		var size : int 
		ghost var maxCapacity : int 
		
		method push(x: T) 
			requires size < maxCapacity 
			modifies this 
			ensures size == old(size) + 1 
		{ 
			data[size] := x; 
			size := size + 1; 
		} 
		
		method pop() returns (r: T) 
			requires size > 0 
			modifies this 
			ensures size == old(size) - 1 
		{ 
			r := data[size - 1]; 
			size := size - 1; 
		} 
		
		method clear() 
			modifies this 
			ensures size == 0 
		{ 
			while size > 0 
				decreases size 
				invariant size >= 0 
				{ 
					size := size - 1; 
				} 
		} 
	}

### Solution:
	class Stack<T> 
	{ 
		var data : array<T> 
		var size : int 
		ghost var maxCapacity : int 
		
		// Representation Invariant 
		ghost predicate Valid() 
			reads this 
		{ 
			0 <= size <= maxCapacity && 
			forall i :: 0 <= i < size ==> data[i] != default(T) 
		} 
		
		// Check if the stack is empty 
		ghost predicate isEmpty() 
			reads this 
		{ 
			size == 0 
		} 
		
		// Check if the stack is not full 
		ghost predicate notFull() 
			reads this 
		{ 
			size < maxCapacity 
		}
		
		method push(x: T) 
			requires notFull() 
			modifies this 
			ensures Valid() 
			ensures size == old(size) + 1 
		{ 
			data[size] := x; 
			size := size + 1; 
		} 
		
		method pop() returns (r: T) 
			requires !isEmpty() 
			modifies this 
			ensures Valid() 
			ensures size == old(size) - 1 
			ensures r == old(data[size - 1])
		{ 
			r := data[size - 1]; 
			size := size - 1; 
		} 
		
		method clear() 
			modifies this 
			ensures isEmpty()
		{ 
			while size > 0 
				decreases size 
				invariant Valid()
				invariant size >= 0 
				{ 
					size := size - 1; 
				} 
		} 
	}

### Group 1: Functional Programming in Coq**

#### Question 1

Consider the following Coq definition of lists of natural numbers:

	Inductive natlist : Type := 
	| nil 
	| cons (n : nat) (l : natlist).

Define a property `ForallNat` that checks if all elements in the list satisfy a predicate PPP.

Rules:

1. **ForallNat_nil**: If the list is empty, `ForallNat P nil` holds.
2. **ForallNat_cons**: If P(n) holds for the head of the list, and `ForallNat P` holds for the tail, then it holds for the entire list.

Complete the following Coq definition:

	Inductive ForallNat : (nat → Prop) → natlist → Prop :=
	 (* Your solution here *)
#### Solution:

	Inductive ForallNat : (nat → Prop) → natlist → Prop := 
	| ForallNat_nil : ∀ P, ForallNat P nil 
	| ForallNat_cons : ∀ (P : nat → Prop) (n : nat) (l : natlist), 
		P n → ForallNat P l → ForallNat P (cons n l).
#### Question 2

Define a property `ExistsNat` that verifies if there exists at least one element in a list that satisfies a predicate PPP.

Rules:

1. **ExistsNat_hd**: If P(n)P(n)P(n) holds for the head of the list, then `ExistsNat P (cons n l)` holds.
2. **ExistsNat_tl**: If `ExistsNat P l` holds for the tail, then it holds for the entire list.

Complete the following Coq definition:

	Inductive ExistsNat : (nat → Prop) → natlist → Prop := 
	(* Your solution here *)

### Solution:

	Inductive ExistsNat : (nat → Prop) → natlist → Prop := 
	| ExistsNat_hd : ∀ (P : nat → Prop) (n : nat) (l : natlist), 
		P n → ExistsNat P (cons n l) 
		| ExistsNat_tl : ∀ (P : nat → Prop) (n : nat) (l : natlist), 
		ExistsNat P l → ExistsNat P (cons n l).
### Group 2: Loops and Loop Invariants in Dafny

#### Question 3

Using Dafny, consider the following function `factorial`, which computes the factorial of a non-negative integer n:

	method factorial(n: int) returns (f: int) 
		requires n >= 0 
		ensures f == if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1) 
	{ 
		f := 1; 
		var i := 1; 
		while i <= n 
			decreases n - i 
			invariant 1 <= i <= n + 1 
			invariant f == if i == 1 then 1 else factorial(i - 1) 
		{ 
			f := f * i; 
			i := i + 1; 
		} 
	}

- Complete the loop invariants and decreasing measure in the `factorial` method so that it verifies successfully in Dafny.
- Briefly explain the purpose of each invariant and how it ensures the correctness of the function.
### Solution:

	method factorial(n: int) returns (f: int) 
		requires n >= 0 
		ensures f == if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1) 
	{ 
		f := 1; 
		var i := 1; 
		while i <= n 
			decreases n - i 
			invariant 1 <= i <= n + 1 
			invariant f == if i == 1 then 1 else factorial(i - 1) 
		{ 
			f := f * i; 
			i := i + 1; 
		} 
	}

#### Question 4

Using Hoare logic, prove the correctness of the following program snippet for finding the minimum value in an array:

	method findMin(a: array<int>, n: int) returns (minVal: int) 
		requires n > 0 && n <= a.Length 
		ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> a[i] >= minVal 
	{ 
		minVal := a[0]; 
		var i := 1; 
		while i < n 
			decreases n - i 
			invariant 1 <= i <= n 
			invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> a[j] >= minVal 
		{ 
			if a[i] < minVal 
			{ 
				minVal := a[i]; 
			} 
			i := i + 1; 
		} 
	}

Explain the following:

1. The meaning of each invariant in the `findMin` method.
2. Why the invariants are necessary to prove the correctness of the method.

### Solution:
The `findMin` function is designed to iterate over the array `a` and find the minimum value in the first `n` elements. The following invariants are essential:

1. **Invariant `1 <= i <= n`**: This ensures that the loop variable `i` is within the correct bounds, starting from 1 and incrementing up to `n`.
    
2. **Invariant `forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> a[j] >= minVal`**: This invariant asserts that `minVal` is the minimum value found in the portion of the array from `a[0]` to `a[i-1]`. It ensures that after each iteration, `minVal` holds the minimum value of the array segment examined so far.

These invariants are crucial because they establish that at each step of the loop, `minVal` holds the smallest value encountered so far, guaranteeing that at the end of the loop, `minVal` will contain the smallest value in the entire range `[0, n)`.

### Group 3: Abstract Data Types

#### Question 5

Consider an abstract data type `Stack` implemented in Dafny. It provides methods `push` and `pop`, as well as a predicate `isEmpty` to check if the stack is empty.

Define the Dafny methods for `push`, `pop`, and `peek`, including appropriate pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants.
:
	

	class Stack<T> { 
		var data: array<T> 
		var size: int 
		ghost var maxCapacity: int 
		
		constructor (capacity: int) 
			requires capacity > 0 
			ensures size == 0 && maxCapacity == capacity 
		{ 
			data := new T[capacity]; 
			size := 0; 
		} 
		
		method push(x: T) 
			requires size < maxCapacity 7
			modifies this 
			ensures size == old(size) + 1 
		{ 
			// Your code here
		} 
		
		method pop() returns (r: T) 
			requires size > 0 
			modifies this 
			ensures size == old(size) - 1 
		{ 
			// Your code here
		} 
		
		method peek() returns (r: T) 
			requires size > 0 
			ensures r == data[size - 1] 
		{ 
			// Your code here
		} 
	}

- Write the code for `push`, `pop`, and `peek` methods.
- Explain the pre- and post-conditions for each method.
### Solution:

	
	class Stack<T> { 
		var data: array<T> 
		var size: int 
		ghost var maxCapacity: int 
		
		constructor (capacity: int) 
			requires capacity > 0 
			ensures size == 0 && maxCapacity == capacity 
		{ 
			data := new T[capacity]; 
			size := 0; 
		} 
		
		method push(x: T) 
			requires size < maxCapacity 7
			modifies this 
			ensures size == old(size) + 1 
		{ 
			data[size] := x; 
			size := size + 1;
		} 
		
		method pop() returns (r: T) 
			requires size > 0 
			modifies this 
			ensures size == old(size) - 1 
		{ 
			r := data[size - 1]; 
			size := size - 1;
		} 
		
		method peek() returns (r: T) 
			requires size > 0 
			ensures r == data[size - 1] 
		{ 
			r := data[size - 1];
		} 
	}

#### Question 6

Based on the lecture on loop invariants, analyze the following code that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers. Complete the loop invariant and verify the code:

	method sumFirstN(n: int) returns (sum: int) 
		requires n >= 0 
		ensures sum == n * (n + 1) / 2 
	{ 
		sum := 0; 
		var i := 0; 
		while i <= n 
			decreases n - i 
			invariant 0 <= i <= n + 1 
			invariant sum == i * (i - 1) / 2 
		{ 
			sum := sum + i; 
			i := i + 1; 
		} 
	} 

- Complete the loop invariants and decreasing measure to verify the code.
- Briefly explain each invariant and its role in proving the correctness of the code.
### Solution:

	method sumFirstN(n: int) returns (sum: int) 
		requires n >= 0 
		ensures sum == n * (n + 1) / 2 
	{ 
		sum := 0; 
		var i := 0; 
		while i <= n 
			decreases n - i 
			invariant 0 <= i <= n + 1 
			invariant sum == i * (i - 1) / 2 
		{ 
			sum := sum + i; 
			i := i + 1; 
		} 
	} 



## 3.
### Group 1: Coq Basics and Induction**

#### Question 1

Consider the following Coq function, which calculates the nth power of a natural number:

	Fixpoint power (n m : nat) : nat :=
		 match m with 
		 | 0 => 1 
		 | S m' => n * power n m' 
		 end.

- Write a statement and proof for the following lemma in Coq:
    
    - **Lemma**: `power_n_0` states that for any natural number nnn, `power n 0` equals 1.
- Use **induction** to prove the following lemma:
    
    - **Lemma**: `power_add` states that for any natural numbers nnn, mmm, and ppp, `power n (m + p) = power n m * power n p`.
- Explain how the **induction principle** works in Coq and why induction is suitable for proving properties of the `power` function.


#### Solution:

**Lemma `power_n_0`**: For any natural number nnn, `power n 0` is equal to 1:

	Lemma power_n_0 : forall n : nat, power n 0 = 1.
	 Proof. 
		intros n. 
		simpl. 
		reflexivity. 
	Qed.

**Lemma `power_add`**: For any natural numbers nnn, mmm, and ppp, `power n (m + p) = power n m * power n p`:

	Lemma power_add : forall n m p : nat, power n (m + p) = power n m * power n p. 
	Proof. 
		intros n m p. 
		induction m as [| m' IH].
		- simpl. reflexivity. 
		- simpl. rewrite IH. rewrite Nat.mul_assoc. reflexivity. 
	Qed.

**Induction Principle Explanation**: In Coq, the induction principle allows us to define properties over data types like natural numbers by specifying a base case and a recursive step. This principle is particularly suitable for recursive functions like `power` because it follows the natural structure of recursive definitions in Coq.

#### Question 2

Define a function `double` in Coq that doubles a natural number:

	Fixpoint double (n : nat) : nat := 
		match n with 
		| 0 => 0 
		| S n' => S (S (double n')) 
		end.

Prove the following lemmas using structural induction on `n`:

1. **Lemma**: `double_plus` states that `double n = n + n`.
2. **Lemma**: `double_injective` states that if `double n = double m`, then `n = m`.

Explain how Coq’s **structural induction** differs from **mathematical induction** and why it is used here.
### Solution:

**Lemma `double_plus`**: `double n = n + n`:

	Lemma double_plus : forall n : nat, double n = n + n. 
	Proof. 
		induction n as [| n' IH]. 
		- simpl. reflexivity. 
		- simpl. rewrite IH. rewrite <- Nat.add_succ_l. reflexivity. 
	Qed.

**Lemma `double_injective`**: If `double n = double m`, then `n = m`:

	Lemma double_injective : forall n m : nat, double n = double m -> n = m. 
	Proof. 
		intros n m H. 
		induction n as [| n' IH]; destruct m as [| m']. 
		- reflexivity. 
		- simpl in H. discriminate. 
		- simpl in H. discriminate. 
		- simpl in H. apply Nat.succ_inj in H. apply IH in H. rewrite H. reflexivity. 
	Qed.

**Difference between Structural and Mathematical Induction**: Structural induction in Coq is based on the recursive structure of the data type rather than numerical properties alone. It’s particularly useful in Coq because each case corresponds to a recursive pattern.

### Group 2: Loops and Loop Invariants in Dafny

#### Question 3

Using Coq, define and prove basic logical connectives. Define the following in Coq:

1. **Definition**: `And (P Q : Prop) := P /\ Q`.
2. **Definition**: `Or (P Q : Prop) := P \/ Q`.

Prove the following lemmas:

1. **Lemma**: Commutativity of `And`: `P /\ Q -> Q /\ P`.
2. **Lemma**: Associativity of `Or`: `(P \/ (Q \/ R)) -> ((P \/ Q) \/ R)`.
3. **Lemma**: Distributivity of `And` over `Or`: `P /\ (Q \/ R) -> (P /\ Q) \/ (P /\ R)`.

Explain the **constructive** approach to proofs in Coq and why logical connectives need to be proven constructively.

### Solution:

	Lemma and_comm : forall P Q : Prop, P /\ Q -> Q /\ P. 
	Proof. 
		intros P Q [HP HQ]. split; assumption. 
	Qed.

	Lemma or_assoc : forall P Q R : Prop, P \/ (Q \/ R) -> (P \/ Q) \/ R. 
	Proof. 
		intros P Q R [HP | [HQ | HR]]. 
		- left. left. assumption. 
		- left. right. assumption. 
		- right. assumption. 
	Qed.

	Lemma and_or_dist : forall P Q R : Prop, P /\ (Q \/ R) -> (P /\ Q) \/ (P /\ R). 
	Proof. 
		intros P Q R [HP [HQ | HR]]. 
		- left. split; assumption. 
		- right. split; assumption. 
	Qed.

**Constructive Proofs in Coq**: Coq requires constructive proofs, meaning each logical statement is proven by providing a witness or constructive method to demonstrate it. This approach ensures that proofs correspond to computational content.

#### Question 4

Consider the inductive definition of **even numbers** in Coq:

	Inductive even : nat -> Prop := 
	| even_0 : even 0 
	| even_SS : forall n : nat, even n -> even (S (S n)).

1. Prove by induction that `even n -> exists k, n = 2 * k`.
    
2. Define an **inductive proposition** `leq` for "less than or equal to" (`<=`) in Coq:

		Inductive leq : nat -> nat -> Prop := 
		| leq_n : forall n, leq n n 
		| leq_S : forall n m, leq n m -> leq n (S m).

3. Prove the **transitivity** of `leq`: `forall n m p, leq n m -> leq m p -> leq n p`.

Explain the **usefulness of inductively defined propositions** like `even` and `leq` in defining and proving properties about natural numbers in Coq.
### Solution:

**Proof of `even n -> exists k, n = 2 * k`**:

	Lemma even_double : forall n, even n -> exists k, n = 2 * k. 
	Proof. 
		intros n H. 
		induction H as [| n' H' IH]. 
		- exists 0. simpl. reflexivity. 
		- destruct IH as [k IHk]. exists (S k). simpl. rewrite <- IHk. reflexivity. 
	Qed.

**Inductive Proposition `leq`**:

	Inductive leq : nat -> nat -> Prop := 
	| leq_n : forall n, leq n n 
	| leq_S : forall n m, leq n m -> leq n (S m).

**Transitivity of `leq`**:

	Lemma leq_trans : forall n m p, leq n m -> leq m p -> leq n p. 
	Proof. 
		intros n m p Hnm Hmp. 
		induction Hmp. 
		- assumption. 
		- apply leq_S. apply IHHmp. assumption. 
	Qed.

**Usefulness of Inductive Definitions**: Inductively defined propositions allow precise definitions of properties like `even` or `leq` using base and recursive cases, enabling us to create proofs that reflect the structure of natural numbers.

### Group 3: Abstract Data Types

#### Question 5

Consider the following program to compute the sum of the first `n` integers in pseudocode:

	sum := 0; 
	i := 0; 
	while i <= n do 
		sum := sum + i; 
		i := i + 1;

- Using **Hoare Logic**, write down the **pre-condition** and **post-condition** for this program.
    
- Identify an appropriate **loop invariant** and use it to formally prove the partial correctness of this program.
    
- Explain the **importance of invariants** in Hoare logic and how they help in reasoning about loops.
### Solution:

1. **Pre-condition and Post-condition**:
    
    - **Pre-condition**: `n >= 0`
    - **Post-condition**: `sum = n * (n + 1) / 2`
2. **Loop Invariant**: `sum = i * (i - 1) / 2` and `0 <= i <= n + 1`.
    
3. **Explanation of Invariants in Hoare Logic**: Invariants are conditions that remain true throughout the execution of the loop, providing a foundation for reasoning about the loop’s correctness and its final outcome.

#### Question 6

In Floyd’s paper, program correctness is established by assigning **assertions** at specific points in the program. Consider the following simple program to find the minimum of two integers a and b:

	if a <= b then 
		min := a 
	else 
		min := b

- Assign **pre-conditions** and **post-conditions** to each branch in this program and verify its correctness.
    
- Discuss the difference between **partial correctness** and **total correctness**. Which does Floyd’s method address, and why?
### Solution:

1. **Pre-conditions and Post-conditions**:
    
    - **Pre-condition**: None required since we simply compare values.
    - **Post-condition**: `min = a \/ min = b` and `min <= a /\ min <= b`.
2. **Difference between Partial and Total Correctness**: Partial correctness ensures that if a program terminates, it produces the correct result. Total correctness additionally requires that the program terminates.

### Group 4: Persistent Data Structures and Functional Programming

#### Question 7

In Okasaki’s Bankers Queue, a persistent queue is implemented using two lists. Consider the following simplified pseudocode:

	type Queue = { front: List, rear: List } 
	
	function enqueue(x, Queue(front, rear)) -> Queue
		return Queue(front, x :: rear) 
		 
	function dequeue(Queue(front, rear)) -> (Int, Queue) 
		if front is empty then 
			return (head(reverse(rear)), Queue(reverse(tail(reverse(rear))), [])) 
		else 
			return (head(front), Queue(tail(front), rear))


- Define the **representation invariant** of the queue in terms of its front and rear lists.
    
- Explain why **amortized analysis** is necessary for analyzing the time complexity of `enqueue` and `dequeue`.
    
- Describe how **persistence** in functional data structures is achieved in this queue and why it matters in functional programming.
#### Solution:

1. **Representation Invariant**: The queue’s invariant is that elements in the front are in the correct order, while elements in the rear list are reversed.
    
2. **Amortized Analysis**: Analyzing `enqueue` and `dequeue` with amortized complexity captures the efficiency over multiple operations, as reversing the rear list is rare and only occurs when the front is empty.
    
3. **Persistence in Functional Data Structures**: Persistence ensures previous versions of the data structure remain accessible. In this queue, persistence is maintained by functional updates, avoiding destructive changes.


#### Question 8

Define a stack in Coq as follows:

	Inductive stack (X : Type) : Type :=
	 | empty : stack X 
	 | push : X -> stack X -> stack X.

1. Define a function `top` that returns the top element of the stack if it exists, and prove a lemma that states `top (push x s) = x`.
    
2. Define a predicate `sorted_stack` for a stack of natural numbers that holds if every element is less than or equal to the one below it.
    
3. Prove that if `sorted_stack s` holds and `push x s` is still a sorted stack, then xxx must be less than or equal to the top element of sss.
    

Explain how inductive definitions and proofs help ensure the correctness of data structures like the stack.

#### Solution:

**Function `top`**:

	Definition top {X : Type} (s : stack X) : option X :=
		 match s with 
		 | empty => None 
		 | push x _ => Some x 
		 end. 
		 
	Lemma top_push : forall (X : Type) (x : X) (s : stack X), top (push x s) = Some x. 
	Proof. 
		intros X x s. 
		simpl. 
		reflexivity. 
	Qed.

**Predicate `sorted_stack`**:

	Inductive sorted_stack : stack nat -> Prop := 
	| sorted_empty : sorted_stack empty 
	| sorted_push : forall n m s, sorted_stack s -> n <= m -> sorted_stack (push m s).

**Proof of Sorted Property**:

	Lemma sorted_push_condition : forall x y s, sorted_stack (push x s) -> x <= y. 
	Proof. 
		intros x y s Hsorted. 
		inversion Hsorted; subst. 
		assumption. 
	Qed.

Inductive proofs ensure that each possible configuration of the stack is verified to maintain correctness, allowing us to define properties like ordering within the data structure.

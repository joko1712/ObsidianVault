
# 1. YouTuFy

Create an app that reads a YouTube playlist and creates a Spotify one that is the same as the YouTube one.
Very simple and self explanatory create a app that uses a YouTube playlist tot create a Spotify playlist. The app should store the playlist used and created in a component. we can call it history. Then allow user to "import said playlist to Spotify".

# 2. Word Frequency in Moby Dick**

In the [Word Frequency in Moby Dick](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/1633) project, you will scrape the text of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick and analyse the word frequency using Python’s nltk library. This project introduces key natural language processing (NLP) techniques and helps develop an understanding of how frequently used words reveal patterns in the text. It is a great project for literature enthusiasts, historians, or researchers interested in text mining and linguistic analysis.

# 3. Speech Emotion Recognition with librosa

In the [Speech Emotion Recognition with Librosa](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-mini-project-speech-emotion-recognition) project, you will process sound files using Librosa, sound file, and sklearn for the MLPClassifier to recognize emotion from sound files. 
You will load and process sound files, perform feature extraction, and train the Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier model. The project will teach you the basics of audio processing so that you can advance into training a deep learning model to achieve better accuracy.


# 4. Stock Market Analysis And Forecasting Using Deep Learning

In the [Stock Market Analysis And Forecasting](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/stock-market-analysis-and-forecasting-using-deep-learning-f75052e81301) project, you will use GRUs (Gated Recurrent Unit) to build deep learning forecasting models for predicting stock prices of Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft.
In the first part, you will dive deep into times series analytics to learn about trends and seasonality of stock price, and then you will use this information to process your data and build a GRU model using PyTorch. For guidance, you can check out the [code source](https://github.com/soham2707/Stock-Market-Analysis-And-Forecasting-Using-Deep-Learning/blob/master/Stock_market.ipynb) on GitHub.

# 5. Generate Music using Neural Networks

In the [Generate Music](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5) project, you will use Music21 and Keras to build the LSTM model for generating music. You will learn about MIDI files, Notes, and Chords and train the LSTM model using MIDI files. 
You will also learn to create model architecture, checkpoints, and loss functions and learn to predict notes using random input. The main goal is to use MIDI files to train neural networks, extract output from the model, and convert them into the MP3 music file.
